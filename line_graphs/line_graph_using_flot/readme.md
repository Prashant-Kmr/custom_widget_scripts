__ Summary __

This reference Javascript duplicates the off the shelf Line Graph widget as a custom widget, making a call to the Flot graphing library. Developers can modify to fit their needs with all of the options available to them in the code.  This code assumes that the data and dataport information will be provided on each widget container refresh.
